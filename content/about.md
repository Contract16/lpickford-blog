> Android Java/Kotlin Developer

## Whoami?
I'm a Software Developer currently living in Liverpool, UK, making apps for [Pixelbeard](https://www.pixelbeard.co/). Generally I code in the day, then do some training in the evenings with Capoeira, Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, Climbing, or other exercise in the park/my living room.

## What's my experience?
I started out with native Android/Java development while I was still in University and have worked in small startups/studios since then. I've worked on apps for various clients, and have switched languages/frameworks a few times depending on my roles in any given company. So far I have work as (in order):
- Native Android/Java
- Xamarin/C# Cross Platform Mobile for Android/iOS/UWP
- Spring Boot/Java Back End
- Native Android/Kotlin

## What's this blog about?
This is just a place for me to put my thoughts, experiences, any code I want to share or anything I build which I think may be helpful to other people. This could be in code, exercise, or other aspects of my life.
